After you have downloaded and installed MMM-voice and got it working:

Option: In your MMM-voice folder, rename the MMM-voice.js, MMM-voice.css and node_helper files.

Why? Because the next step will overwrite them. If something goes wrong you'll have a backup.

Take the MMM-voice.js, MMM-voice.css and node_helper files from this folder and move or copy them into your MMM-voice folder.

Take the en.json file from this folder and copy or paste it into the MMM-voice/translations folder
